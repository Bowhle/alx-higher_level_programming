# Python - Object-relational Mapping

This project contains several Python scripts that interact with MySQL databases using both MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy. The tasks include retrieving, filtering, and displaying data from MySQL tables (such as states and cities) while also demonstrating how to prevent SQL injections.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- MySQL Server (running on localhost at port 3306)
- [MySQLdb](https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/) (install with `pip3 install mysqlclient`)
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) (install with `pip3 install SQLAlchemy`)
