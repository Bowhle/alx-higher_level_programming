0x17. C - Doubly Linked Lists
Description
This project focuses on implementing and working with doubly linked lists in the C programming language. A doubly linked list is a data structure where each node contains a reference to both the next and previous nodes in the sequence, allowing for bidirectional traversal. The project introduces various operations on doubly linked lists, including insertion, deletion, and traversal, while adhering to specific project requirements and constraints such as memory management and coding style.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will have learned:

What a doubly linked list is and how it differs from a singly linked list.
How to create and manipulate doubly linked lists in C.
How to insert, delete, and traverse elements in a doubly linked list.
The importance of memory management when dealing with dynamic data structures.
How to adhere to the Betty style guide for coding in C.
