# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It aims to deepen your understanding of classes and objects, including their attributes and methods, as well as special functions provided by Python to enhance the behavior of custom classes.

## Learning Objectives

In this project, you will learn about:
- The concept of OOP and its importance in software development.
- First-class functions and their implications in Python.
- Class vs. Object: Understanding the difference.
- Attributes: Public, protected, and private.
- Special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, and `__doc__`.
- Data encapsulation, abstraction, and information hiding.
- How to use class methods, static methods, and instance methods effectively.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5).
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Your code should conform to `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*).
- All files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
