# Python - Almost a Circle
### Description
This project covers Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It focuses on creating classes to model geometric shapes like rectangles and squares, and includes functionality for serialization and deserialization of objects, file handling, and unit testing.

### Features
* Base class to manage id attribute for all future classes.
* Rectangle class with width, height, x, y attributes and area calculation.
* Square class inheriting from Rectangle with size attribute.
* Serialization to and from JSON format.
* Unit tests to validate functionality.

### Files
+ models/base.py: Contains the Base class.
+ models/rectangle.py: Contains the Rectangle class.
+ models/square.py: Contains the Square class.
